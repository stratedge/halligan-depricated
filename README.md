Halligan
========

Description
-----------
Halligan is a free-to-use library that seeks to create a componentized library system and versioned-extendability.

To-Do List
----------
*	Sanitize input so that it is as safe as possible from XSS and injections
*	Add some simple session handling
*	Maybe add a memcache class?
*	Add joins to the query class
*	Add in support to call pages from the command line (CLI)
*	Adjust the capitalization on files and folders - all lowercase really won't do for multi-word file names
*	3rd party support (try it out with Doctrine to test)
*	Add support for environements, including custom config items for different environments
